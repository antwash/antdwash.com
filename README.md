## ‚ö†Ô∏è Please Read ‚ö†Ô∏è
I had two goals in mind while creating my personal website:
- give external viewers a quick backstory & overview of my journey
- contribute to opensource by coding in public

You may have a similar goal, as a result, **YES you can use this code for your personal website with attribution**.

I've spent a non-trivial amount of effort designing in Figma and building this website, and I am proud of it! ü§ì

All I ask is you not claim this effort as your own and give credit by referencing back to [antdwash.com](https://antdwash.com/)
